> Hauge, E.; Kristiansen, H. E.; Konecny, L.; Kadek, M.; Repisky, M.; Pedersen, T. B. Cost-Efficient High-Resolution Linear Absorption Spectra Through Extrapolating the Dipole Moment from Real-Time Time-Dependent Electronic-Structure Theory. J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2023, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00727


We refer to the [article](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00727) for details on the algorithm.
